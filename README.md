# Breakout Game Tutorial
<i>Make School FEW 1.2</i>

This project is a web version of the classic arcade game Breakout built with canvas, a JavaScript API. Breakout consists of a paddle that the user controls to keep a ball from falling to the bottom edge while the ball ricochets off the paddle and the walls to collide with bricks, with each brick collision earning points. The code for this project is based on this tutorial: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Games/Tutorials/2D_Breakout_game_pure_JavaScript. 

As I followed along with the tutorial, I applied Airbnb's style guide from ESLint to format my code properly. All of the linter errors have been resolved, but there are still two warnings for using `alert()`, which I used for displaying the win and loss screens.

I also completed some stretch challenges, such as: adding an additional row; adding colors to alternating rows (orange and black); changing the colors of the score display, lives display, paddle, and ball; and adding a new scoring system so that each brick in the top row is worth 40 points, each brick in the second row from the top is worth 30 points, each brick in the next row is worth 20 points, and each brick in the bottom row is worth 10 points.
